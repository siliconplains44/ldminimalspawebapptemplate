Single Page Application with Minimal Framework Web Application Template

Professionally I have built web app on almost all major front end networks like Angular and backbone.  What I found was these frameworks were quite bloated and quite large for what they offered.  For the most part, web development is pretty easy and should stay simplistic and easy.

I decided to experiment with constructing my own simplified single page application framework.  As a joke I call it minimal as I wanted to create the smallest footprint javascript file I could to support a dynamic single page web application.

This project contains all of my starter code for a Node.JS express application that uses my minimal spa framework.  You can basically download this set of starter files and bring up a spa app in no time and along the way actually understand all the code that drives your application, unlike what you typically find when using much larger frameworks.

A real working spa application that uses this framework is hosted at https://store.leoparddata.com.
